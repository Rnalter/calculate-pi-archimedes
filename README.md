Quick python script to calculate Pi as Archimedes did it manually


# What is Pi?
The constant ratio between the circumference and diameter of every circle in this universe

# how did Archimedes calculate this ratio in 200 BC?
By approximation, starting with a hexagon (6 sides) within a circle

Assuming the hexagon having side length of 1

Circumference of hexagon = 1 * 6 = 6

Diamater of hexagon/circle = 1 * 2 = 2

Hence ratio = 6/2 = 3
